## Project description
The project we propose is a robot teleoperated via Bluetooth, whose purpose is to allow its user to collect various household items from the comfort of their couch, without the need to do it themselves, operating the robot through a Bluetooth remote with a screen. The prototype demonstrates the idea and consists of a manipulator robot mounted on a mobile platform, with the aim of illustrating our motivation. Although the current prototype has certain limitations: this robot can lift objects up to 100g, such as bottle caps, tissue packs, or pens.

All the project documentation is available in the file "MemoriaSEPA.pdf"

For teleoperation, we have built a Bluetooth control remote with two joysticks and a touchscreen with a simple user interface that allows teleoperating both the mobile platform and the manipulator robot of the prototype from anywhere in the house.

Our motivation is to help elderly people tidy up their homes without having to perform complex movements such as bending down, moving furniture, or reaching difficult areas of the home, all without assistance.

## Development
Both the prototype and the control remote use a Texas Instruments TIVA TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller to implement the project's functionality, and both have been programmed using the "Code Composer Studio" software from the same manufacturer.
This work is intended as an academic deliverable and is currently closed, so it will not receive future updates. However, you are free to fork it and complement it as you wish.
